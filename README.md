Introduction (10 pts)
  What is the main theme? Why is it important?

Equations (10 pts)
  What are the fundamental physical/chemical/etc. processes? 
  Relevant equations and potentially where they come from (i.e. how are they derived)
  Describe all terms and parameters. 
  Describe any assumptions being made

Numerical methods (20 pts)
  Describe the numerical methods used.
  Why did you choose to use these methods
  Code works as intended

Results (20 pts)
  What simulations did you run with the model?
  Describe the results.
  How do the results compare with any known solutions, or data?
  How do the results change with different methods, time steps, grid spacing, or model parameters?
  What did the model tell you about the process you were studying?
  How could the model be improved in terms of methods used or processes included?

Figures (10 pts)
  At least 4 figures describing results 
  Have all axes labeled
  Variables have units
  Everything is readable
  Colors, lines, contours, etc. are all easy to discern

Video walkthrough (20 pts) 
  Either linked at top of notebook or embedded in notebook
  Includes all team members
